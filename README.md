# ClassificationProject-IrisDataSet
Welcome to my Iris Data Project

I have created 3 different models to classify Iris species based on petal length and width, and sepal length and width.
The three models I used include a Support Vector Machine model, a Linear Regression model, and a Decision Tree. You can try out each one for yourself!
I also have a separate page of code where I attempted using a neural network. I was already aware it wouldn't be the most accurate, however I wanted to take a shot at creating one. 
Try out whichever you like.
Enjoy!
